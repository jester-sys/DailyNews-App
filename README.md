## Architecture

The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, which separates the concerns of data management, UI rendering, and user interactions.

- **Model**: Handles data operations and API requests. It includes classes such as `NewsRepository`, `WeatherRepository`, and `ChatRepository` responsible for fetching news articles, weather data, and handling chat interactions.
- **View**: Displays the user interface and handles user interactions. It includes activities, fragments, and layout files responsible for rendering news articles, weather information, and chat conversations.
- **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between the Model and View components. It provides data to the View, handles user actions, and updates the Model accordingly. The ViewModel also abstracts the business logic, allowing for better testability and separation of concerns.
